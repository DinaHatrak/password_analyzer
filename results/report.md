# Password Analysis Report
This project provides a comprehensive security assessment for passwords.

## Key Metrics:
- **Shannon Entropy:** Measures mathematical randomness.
- **NIST Compliance:** Checks against global security standards.
- **Crack Time Estimation:** Predicts brute-force vulnerability.

*Results are generated based on the logic implemented in the src/ and analysis/ folders.*
